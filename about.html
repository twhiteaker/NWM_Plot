   <h1>About NWM Plot</h1>
   <p><a href="index.html">NWM Plot Demo</a></p>
   <p><a href="https://github.com/twhiteaker/NWM_Plot" rel="noopener noreferrer">NWM Plot on GitHub</a></p>
   <p>This project demonstrates how to plot a time series of streamflow using <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/"
         rel="noopener noreferrer">Chart.js</a>.
   </p>
   <h2>Data Sources</h2>
   <p>
      Streamflow data originate from the NOAA's
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm">National Water Model (NWM)</a>. The data can
      be read
      from two sources:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f43c154ef3b9421bbda14bc17f9e98d2" rel="noopener noreferrer">a
            map service hosted by Esri</a> - This service is for the medium range forecast only, and is only updated
         daily.
         This project was initially developed for this service. With the introduction of the National Water Prediction
         Service API for the NWM,
         relying on Esri to harvest and provide access to the data is not required; however, it may be still beneficial
         to use the Esri service so that plotted data match
         with what is available from the Esri map service.
      </li>
      <li>
         <a href="https://preview-api.water.noaa.gov/nwps/v1/docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Water
            Prediction Service (NWPS) API</a> -
         This service is in beta at the time of this writing. It provides access to estimates of recent streamflow via
         Analysis and Assimilation results, and the latest forecast for
         Short Range, Medium Range, and Long Range model runs. While medium and long range forecasts include ensembles,
         only the mean value is currently plotted for this project.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Usage</h2>
   <p>All times in the chart are in the user's local time zone, even if the user is viewing a stream segment that is not
      in the user's time zone.</p>
   <p>NWM Plot accepts these inputs:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <strong>Feature ID</strong> - The identifier for the National Water Model stream reach for which streamflow should be downloaded
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Source</strong> - Choose from the four NWPS products or the Esri medium range forecast data
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Show Ensemble Members If Available</strong> - If this is checked and the source is an ensemble forecast (medium range and long range as of this writing),
         then each ensemble member is included in the graph along with the mean. If unchecked, only the mean is included. This option does nothing if
         no ensembles are available.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Show Cumulative Volume</strong> - Select this option to include a series representing the cumulative volume of water
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Hide Input Form</strong> - Select this option to hide the input form. The input form is useful if you are trying out the
         application, but you may want to hide it
         if you are linking to the application from another page and are supplying URL arguments for data retrieval.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Plot</strong> - Click this to plot data after adjusting inputs.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      Use the input form and click Plot to see URL argument names and values.
