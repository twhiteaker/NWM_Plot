   <p>This project demonstrates how to plot a time series of streamflow using <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/"
         rel="noopener noreferrer">Chart.js</a>. The streamflow data originate from the 10-day forecast of NOAA's
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm">National Water Model</a>. The data are read
      from <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f43c154ef3b9421bbda14bc17f9e98d2"
         rel="noopener noreferrer">a map service hosted by Esri</a>, which has the benefit of including many river
      names.</p>
   <p>All times in the chart are in the user's local time zone, even if the user if viewing a stream segment that is not
      in the user's time zone.</p>
